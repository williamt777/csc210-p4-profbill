This repo holds my solution to Program #4 in CSC210, Spring 2020.

My original repo with shared code is at: https://github.com/williamt777/csc210-program4

I did two Prim's implementations. One uses an accounting object to follow Prim's while it's running. The other, Prims2, maintains a priority queue of edges and is a little smarter about marking verts while running. Prims2 is more Sedgewick-y.

thanks...yow, bill
